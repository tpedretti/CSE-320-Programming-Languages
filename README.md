README For CSE-320 Repository
==========================


# CSE-320 - Programming Languages
**Course Description:** 

Topics include formal language specification, data types and their implementation, abstract mechanisms, control structures, run-time representations and storage management. Several high-level languages will be examined.

# LABS

**Lab 1:**

Lab01 is about expressions and how they are used in programming using the Racket Language. This lab mainly focus getting use to Racket.

**Lab 2:**

Lab02 is about functions and how they are used in programming using the Racket Language. In this lab, we will discuss functions, the core of functional programming. In particular, we will
explore the ideas of __anonymous functions__ (also called __lambdas__), __currying__, __partial application__,
and __higher-order functions__.


**Lab 3:**

Last lab to for using Racket. In this lab, we will be worked with macros and how they work in programming languages, specifically:

- Quoting
- Unquoting
- Quasiquoting
- Pattern-Based Macros
- Procedural Macros
- Homoiconicity
- Macros vs. Functions

**Lab 4:**

This lab we were introduced to the Rust programming language, and the core ideas Rust uses to ensure memory safety without manual memory management or garbage collection. These core ideas are ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.

**Lab 5:**

Used Rust to see how concurrency & parallelism works in programming languages.

**Lab 6:**

In this lab we will walk through the ways in which Rust’s design facilitates safety, how Rust’s safety guarantees interact with its low-level programming capabilities, and how Rust’s definition of safety interacts with our understanding of security in low-level programming.

**Lab 7:**

Lab 7 was the start of using Java for covering classes, objects, subclassing, composition vs. inheritance, subtype polymorphism, and abstract data types in programming languages.

**Lab 8:**

In this lab we talked about some common and important concepts and patterns in object–oriented design. These are not specific to Java, but we will of course be using Java as the illustrating language.

**Lab 9:**

Started to use Prolog which is a language very different from the ones you've seen so far. Don't worry too much about being productive in it. Just try and focus on the ideas from Prolog that we're focusing on. (Of course, if you find it interesting, then by all means dive in deeper than we go in these labs!)

Prolog is a _logic programming language_, this is a programming paradigm that looks like and works similarly to formal logic.
